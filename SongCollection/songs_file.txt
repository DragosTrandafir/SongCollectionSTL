__Artist: Taylor Swift
__Song: Style
__Lyrics:
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

__Artist: Lana Del Rey
__Song: Candy Necklace
__Lyrics:
White fire, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at the stoplight northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise coming out of my brain
Turns off for nothing

__Artist: Lana Del Rey
__Song: High By The Beach
__Lyrics:
High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh
Boy, look at you looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal, I can't survive
If this is all that's real

__Artist: Taylor Swift
__Song: So Long, London
__Lyrics:
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped trying to make him laugh
Stopped trying to drill the safe
Thinkin, how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
Oh, the tragedy ...

__Artist: Madonna
__Song: Rebel Heart
__Lyrics:
I've lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say,
'Told you so, told you so!
Why can't you be like the other girls?'
I said, 'Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be'
Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Trying to fit in but it wasn't me
I said, 'Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for'
