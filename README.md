# SongCollectionSTL
Using STL containers and lambda expression to handle a song collection.

All the necessary details regarding the code are provided in the requirement pictures and in comments next to the code. In 2 lamba expression requirements, you need to remove the comments for the code to function( it is mentioned in the code where you need to do this ).

TO RUN THE PROJECT, create a project in a C++ IDE, I recommend Visual Studio Community or C Lion. Copy all the headers (.h) ,cpp (.cpp) files + songs_file.txt and after that run the Source.cpp.
